Hereâ€™s a summarized plan based on your new direction for the Battleship game project:

### New Game Plan for Battleship

1. **Setup Phase:**

   - Players no longer use drag-and-drop for ships; instead, use a **button-based interface**.
   - Clicking the "Change Position" button will **randomly place ships** until the player is satisfied.
   - Once the player confirms the placement, the **"Play" button** starts the game.

2. **Computer's Setup:**

   - The computerâ€™s ships are **randomly placed** using an automatic randomizer.

3. **Gameplay:**

   - Players take turns selecting buttons (grid cells) to attack.
   - When a player hits a ship:
     - They get an **extra turn**.
     - A **hit emoji** (e.g., ðŸš¢ or ðŸ’¥) is displayed.
   - When a player misses:
     - An **"X"** mark is shown on the grid.ðŸš¢

4. **Objective:**
   - Sink all the opponent's ships to win the game.

This new plan should simplify the project while making the game more user-friendly and visually engaging. Let me know if you want any specific implementation help or advice on structuring the code!
